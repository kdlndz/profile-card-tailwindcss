This simple project is an exercise to try how I can translate my old CSS code into Tailwindcss.

In this project called Profile Card, it shows my name, title and social links where to reach and contact me.

What I wanted to get from this activity is how fast, knowledgeable and ready I am to start my journey in Tailwind.
I'll update this document when I finish and list down what are my struggles and learnings I get from this.
