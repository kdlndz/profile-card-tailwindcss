This simple project is an exercise to try how I can translate my old CSS code into Tailwindcss.

In this project called Profile Card, it shows my name, title and social links where to reach and contact me.

What I wanted to get from this activity is how fast, knowledgeable and ready I am to start my journey in Tailwind.
I'll update this document when I finish and list down what are my struggles and learnings I get from this.

UPDATE
Just finished transitioning old css code into tailwind.
What I noticed when doing this is  you can use old sizing and add hex code just by using these []. It helps a lot.
Also, when centering some image the use of mx-auto is a huge help. It sets everything into place, at least in this project.

What I struggled while coding this is the adjustment of sizing. I want to use the available suggestions and finding the right size made me use the [] method.

I really like how Tailwind looks. It is very efficient and fast to code especially if you already know and mastered CSS.
